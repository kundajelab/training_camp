    "When many users are trying to do data processing on a server and there are limited computing resources, how is the distribution of the computing resources handled? On SCG (https://srcc.stanford.edu/scg-genomics-cluster-genomics-scale), Sherlock (https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/) and many other servers, this is handled using the SLURM,Sherlock uses Slurm, an open-source resource manager and job scheduler. The basic idea is that the users puts the commands they want to run in a shell script, and then submits that script to the scheduler using qsub. If you do NOT use this approach, and instead execute the commands directly on your login shell, you will be running the commands on what is called the \"head node\", which is NOT equipped to do heavy lifting; if your commands require a lot of computing resources, you will end up making the head node slow for ALL users who log in, and everyone will hate you even if they may not know who you are. Or even worse -- your job will simply be killed by the sysadmins. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short: always use qsub for computationally intensive things.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will walk through an example. Here is a reference for using SLURM from the SCG website: \n",
    "*  https://docs.scg.stanford.edu/scg-user-guide/wiki/SchedulerReference\n",
    "\n",
    "And a similar reference from the Sherlock website -- Sherlock is another widely used compute cluster at Stanford; you interact with it in the same way as you do with SCG. We will refer to SCG in further discussion, but much of this information is transferable to working on Sherlock. \n",
    "* https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/docs/getting-started/submitting/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, for SCG, jobs have a memory limit of 3.7GB (per slot; parallel processing jobs may use multiple slots) and jobs in the standard queue have a runtime limit of 6 hours (wallclock, not CPU time).\n",

    "In order to run jobs, you have to put the commands in a shell script (see section 1.2) "

However, sometimes jobs just stop running due to memory issues, etc. For this reason it is SUPER SUPER IMPORTANT to end your scripts with a printout that says \"Done\" (or anything you want for that matter). Then, if you see that printout in your .out file you know the job successfully completed. If you do not see it, then you know that there was a problem with the job, even if there is no explicit error message. Such a \"Done\" print statement is present in the code we provide and should serve as an important example for ANY script you write."
