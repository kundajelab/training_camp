    "1. Use `gzip` and `gunzip` to compress and decompress a few files. With `ls -l`, check that the size of the file (in bytes) is smaller when it is compressed than when it is not. What kinds of files shrink more/less when you compress them? Try it out on text/bed files as well as PNG files in the images directory.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Compress the bed file from the previous exercises section, and then use `zcat [gzipped file] | head` and confirm that the output is the same as when you run `head` on the non-gzipped file. Try out the `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` commands we ran on the bed file in the previous section, but using `zcat` and the pipe so that you avoid decompressing the bed file.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Try out interesting combinations of commands using piping. Can you combine `head` and `tail` to extract lines 101 to 201 from the bed file? Can you string together multiple `sed` commands to change all I numerals to \"-one\", all Vs to \"-five\", and all Xs to \"-ten\"?\n",

There are many different kinds of shells, and different commands are slightly different depending on the shell that is being run, but bash is pretty standard.\n",

    "The `$PATH` variable stores the names of a number of directories, each separated by a colon. When you enter a command in the terminal, the shell looks at each of these directories in `$PATH` in turn, checking if a runnable file (also called an \"executable\") exists in any of those directories and has the same name as the command you typed. Once it finds such an executable, it stops looking and executes it.\n",
