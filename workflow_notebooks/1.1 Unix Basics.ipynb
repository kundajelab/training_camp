    "We'll start by going through some basic unix commands. \"Unix\" is a term for a family of operating systems (just like \"Windows\"). The Mac operating systems (OSX) are part of the Unix family. You will also hear the term \"Linux\" a lot - linux refers to series of operating systems that are also part of the Unix family. Unix operating systems are very popular for running servers. However, while you may be used to interacting with your laptop using a graphical interface, these servers do not support graphical interfaces (as graphical interfaces are a LOT of work to build and are less flexible). Instead, you need to interact with them through the command line. Don't worry, it's easy once you get the hang of it, and it looks really cool to people who don't know what you are doing!"

If you hear the term \"bash\" get thrown around, just know that this is the name of a shell. There are many different kinds of shells, and different commands are slightly different depending on the shell that is being run. For now, we will focus on the bash shell. To use the bash shell through an ipython notebook, add an exclamation point (!) before the command, as illustrated below (run the code in the following shell)"

    "[name of the program] [one or more arguments to the program...]<br />\n",
    "(\"arguments\" just refers to all the terms that control the behaviour of the program).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, \"echo\" is the name of the program. The echo program prints the value of its arguments to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a concept of an \"environment variable\". A variable is something that stores information, and an \"environment variable\" is something that stores information that can be accessed by the shell (i.e. they pertain to the \"environment\" that commands are run in). Environment variables can be accessed by using \"\\$\" (so \\$SHELL produces the value of the SHELL variable). In the example above, \\$SHELL gives the location where the current shell program is stored. On my Mac, this location happens to be /bin/bash. It may be slightly different when you run this notebook, but it should still end in \"bash\".\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we read a path like \"/bin/bash\"? Files in a Unix system are organized into folders (also called \"directories\"). \"/\" refers to the topmost level. \"/bin\" is the \"bin\" folder (\"bin\" is an abbreviation for \"binaries\"; \"binary\" files refers to the form that runable programs often take). So \"/bin/bash\" refers to the \"bash\" program stored in the \"bin\" folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the shell is told to run a program (like \"echo\"), how does the shell know where to find it? This is where the PATH environment variable comes in. The PATH variable stores the names of a number of directories, each separated by a colon. The shell looks at each of these directories in turn and sees if a runnable file (also called an \"executable\") with the appropriate name exists in any of those directories. Once it finds such an executable, it stops looking and executes it."
