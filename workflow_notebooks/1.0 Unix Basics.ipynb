    "\"Unix\" is a term for a family of operating systems (just like \"Windows\"). The Mac operating systems (OSX) are part of the Unix family. You will also hear the term \"Linux\" a lot - linux is part of the Unix family. Unix operating systems are very popular for running servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you may be used to interacting with your laptop using a mouse and graphical interface, Unix servers like Stanford's Sherlock cluster do not work that way (graphical interfaces are a LOT of work to build and are less flexible). Instead, we need to interact with these servers through the command line or terminal. These servers can store enormous files (such as files containing millions of ATAC-seq reads), and they have many CPUs and even GPUs too, which allow us to perform powerful bioinformatic analyses that our laptops just aren't capable of.\n",
